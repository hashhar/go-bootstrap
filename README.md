# Go-Bootstrap

Unified workstation setup.

The idea behind this is to have a single manifest file which can then be used to
generate an Ansible playbook to apply the manifest across operating systems and
architectures.

This is currently a work in progress and really really unstable. Although feel
to discuss this with me by opening an issue.
